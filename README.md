# Templating
    Allows us to define a preset "pattern" for a webpage, that we can dynamically modify 
        EX:
            we could define a single "SEARCH" template that displays all the results for a given search term. We do not know what the term is or how many results there are ahead of time. The weboage is created on the fly.
